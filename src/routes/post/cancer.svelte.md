I was diagnosed with a rare form of testicular cancer in late-March, around the time of my engagement with my now-wife Denise. A few surgeries and countless sleepless nights later, it seems I'm ok. Here are some thoughts on getting to "ok".

I knew something was wrong with my body toward the end of February 2021. I waited a few weeks to see if the gut feeling I had would go away. It didn't. I eventually told my then-girlfriend Denise and my mom as a way to force myself into seeing a medical professional.

A couple weeks later, the weekend before I proposed to Denise, I had an appointment for a sonogram. The doctors were convinced during my appointment that this was some minor issue. I received a call about an hour later from a nurse in a worried tone telling me everything would be alright. No one told me what was wrong, just that I needed to see a specialist.
