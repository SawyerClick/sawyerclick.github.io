Bye, Business Insider. Hello, [The DataFace](https://thedataface.com/)! I'm joining the data viz agency in early Jan. 2022 as a developer. Here's a quick list of things I'm most excited about:

- Clients vs. reporters
- Slower pace, bigger projects
- Learning new things like THREE.js and WebGl tech

## #On leaving Insider

I spent 15-ish months at the company as the first graphics developer. I accomplished - and more importantly learned - a lot in my time there.

I built iterations 1, 2 and 3 of our development and publication pipeline, including several templates. I learned Svelte. I told stories about [Mark Zuckerberg's takeover of Hawaiian land](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-kauai-estate-hawaii-land-appropriation-history-2021-11) and created a news app  [ranking members of Congress](https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-conflicts-congress-members-rated-2021-12) on their financial transparency and culpability. But now it's time for the next step.
