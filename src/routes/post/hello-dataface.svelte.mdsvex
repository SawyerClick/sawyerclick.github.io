I'm joining the data viz agency [The DataFace](https://thedataface.com/) in early Jan. 2022 as a developer. I'll be working with a variety of clients on data viz, microsites and more, building with Svelte and D3 along the way. My last day at Business Insider was Jan. 14.

I'm excited to take on bigger projects with a slower pace and learn how to work with clients as opposed to reporters. Journalism is often fast and appreciates brevity - even in charting. I'm looking forward to breaking out of my comfort zone and leaning into tech I haven't explored yet (looking at you Three.js).

## #On leaving Insider

I spent 15-ish months at the company as the first graphics developer. I accomplished - and more importantly - learned a lot in my time there.

I built several iterations of our development and publication pipeline, including several templates. I learned Svelte and picked up a __lot__ about JavaScript and D3. I told stories about [Mark Zuckerberg's takeover of Hawaiian land](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-kauai-estate-hawaii-land-appropriation-history-2021-11) and created a news app  [ranking members of Congress](https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-conflicts-congress-members-rated-2021-12) on their financial transparency and culpability.

As I leave, there is a healthy number of developers on the team and they're still growing.
